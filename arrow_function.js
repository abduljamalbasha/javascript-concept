/**
 * Arrow functions
 * ES6 introduced a new and shorter way of declaring an anonymous function, which is known as Arrow Functions.
 *  In an Arrow function, everything remains the same, except here we don’t need the function keyword also. Here, 
 * we define the function by a single parenthesis and then ‘=>’ followed by the function body.
